# TodoList_console
This is a simple console-based Todo List application built using Python. The purpose of this application is to allow users to create and manage their personal to-do lists.

### Features
The following features will be added to the application:
- __Add tasks__: Users can add tasks to their to-do list by entering a task description.
- __View tasks__: Users can view their entire to-do list or a specific task.
- __Edit tasks__: Users can edit the description of an existing task.
- __Delete tasks__: Users can delete a task from their to-do list.
- __Save tasks__: Users can save their to-do list to a file, and load it again when they launch the application.

### Usage
To use the application, simply clone and run the Python script `console.py` in your console. You will be presented with a menu of options to choose from, including adding a task, viewing your to-do list, editing a task, deleting a task, and saving your to-do list.

```
$ ./console.py
